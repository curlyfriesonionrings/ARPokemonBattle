# ARPokemonBattle

Personal project created after Pokemon GO was released last year. I had some experience with augmented reality and Android programming, so I decided to put something together for fun.

Video demo of the project: https://youtu.be/1ESD4sxN_-o

This demo shows a "local" mode, where an opponent is set up and operates (mostly) randomly. Multiplayer is possible if the app is installed on two phones. An ad-hoc bluetooth connection needs to be set up so the phones can communicate.
